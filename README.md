### 🤔 Use 🤷🏻‍♂️ any front-end tech to build random UI/ UI-Component for fun on your boring time

<br />

Each folder is a project
- Do not push to the `main` branch `(fork, clone, create your own branch, add your project folder...)`
- Please make sure u add a README.md that has a screenshot of your app, aswell instructions on how to run your app
- Make it simple
